  Feature Summary:

  * Click and drag to
      * create entities of many shapes
      * Move, rotate and resize entities
      * Move points to reshape entities
  * Create groups containing entities and other groups
  * Create paths containing lines and curves
  * Copy and paste entire entities or points between entities
  * Change properties including color, width and dashes
  * Apply color gradients to entities and groups
  * Add a note to any entity
  * Use any number of layers
  * Create XY charts anywhere, annotated with CAD entities
  * Export drawings to SVG, PNG or PDF files
  * Save drawings within project databases
  * Use calibrated raster images as background for drawings
  * Automatically create Grids, Legends and Charts
  * More, including Snap, Virtual Points, Arrows and FlipY....

# The path of icon to represent the snap, relative to the source tree directory
# Only PNG or SVG image is supported, dimension must be greater than 256x256px

# Version string just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
# The wrapping single quotes are often required to avoid the version string
# being accidentally interpreted as a YAML non-string(like '1', '1.2').

# (OPTIONAL) The version string can also be dynamically determined via scripting
# , in this case the value of the `version` key will be ignored (but the key is
# still required).

# Security confinement
# Use `devmode` to getting started
# Flip to `strict` once you have the right plugs and slots,
# or `classic` once you determine that strict confinement is not currently possible
confinement: strict

# Snap Grade
# Use `devel` to getting started
# Flip to `stable` once you determine that the snap is matured, only `stable` grade
# snaps can be promoted to `candidate` and `stable` channels
grade: stable

# Refer the following documentation for asserting interface plugs and slots in a security confined snap:

# Apps that are exposed by the snap package
# If the _app_name_ is identical with the _snap_name_ it can be directly run
# with `_snap_name_` or `snap run _snap_name_` commands, otherwise it can only be run
# via `_snap_name_._app_name_` or `snap run _snap_name_._app_name_`

    # The command to run the application, the base command should be an *relative path* to an executable file rooted from the `prime` directory (for `classic` confinement compatiblity, where command search PATHs under $SNAP isn't set for library compatiblity reasons).  The arguments are usually other launchers' *absolute path* rooted from the $SNAP environment variable that are *stacked over* previous ones to consolidate their runtime environment modifications.
    # NOTE: The right angle bracket at the beginning of the value of the `command` keyword starts a YAML folded style block scalar, refer the following spec document for more info: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2796251
